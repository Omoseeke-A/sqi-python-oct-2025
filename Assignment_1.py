"“They say you never forget the sound of your first miracle.” "

"The rain had been falling for seven days straight when Ada found the old radio in her grandmother’s attic."
"It crackled to life with a voice—soft, familiar, impossible."
"“Don’t be afraid, Ada. Follow the light.”"

"The power had been out for hours, yet the bulb above her flickered once, twice, and glowed steady."
"She followed its faint trail through the empty house to the garden, where her grandmother’s roses—dead for years—were blooming again."
"In the silence that followed, the rain stopped."
"The air smelled like new beginnings."
"And the radio whispered one last time, “Miracles remember those who believe.”"

"And Ada finally did."
